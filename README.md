### **Create User Roles**
```sql
CREATE USER 'readonly_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'readonly';
CREATE USER 'dataentry_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'dataentry';
GRANT SELECT ON UniversityHealthCareDB.* TO 'readonly_user'@'%';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON UniversityHealthCareDB.* TO 'dataentry_user'@'%';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON UniversityHealthCareDB.* TO 'admin'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


CREATE VIEW PatientSummary AS
SELECT 
    Patients.PatientID, 
    Patients.Name, 
    COUNT(MedicalRecords.RecordID) AS RecordCount
FROM Patients
LEFT JOIN Appointments ON Patients.PatientID = Appointments.PatientID
LEFT JOIN MedicalRecords ON Appointments.AppointmentID = MedicalRecords.AppointmentID
GROUP BY Patients.PatientID, Patients.Name;


CREATE TRIGGER LogPatientUpdates
AFTER UPDATE ON Patients
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO PatientUpdatesLog (PatientID, UpdatedAt)
  VALUES (NEW.PatientID, NOW());
END;


DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetPatientDetails(IN patientID INT)
BEGIN
  SELECT * FROM Patients WHERE PatientID = patientID;
END //
DELIMITER ;
